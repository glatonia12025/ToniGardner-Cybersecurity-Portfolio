# 👩🏾‍💻 About Toni Gardner

Toni’s journey isn’t the typical “tech from day one” story — and that’s her strategic advantage. For over six years, she honed the art of simplifying complexity, strengthening systems, and building trust — not through code, but in classrooms, teams, and mission-driven environments. As the digital landscape evolved, Toni pivoted from educator to cybersecurity professional, bringing analytical insight, emotional intelligence, and leadership into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).

Today, she’s a Security+ certified GRC Analyst with hands-on experience in auditing, risk assessments, vulnerability analysis, incident response, compliance frameworks, and policy alignment. She completed a multi-stage cybersecurity initiative modeled on real enterprise workflows, combining rigorous analysis with stakeholder-focused reporting.

Toni’s superpower lies in translating security risk into actionable insights. She connects human behavior to security posture, transforming complex data into narratives that executives can use — and teams can act on.

Beyond her technical expertise, Toni is a 200-hour certified yoga and meditation instructor, uniquely equipped to enhance team resilience, reduce burnout, and foster calm, focused decision-making in high-pressure environments.

She’s not just entering cybersecurity — she’s elevating it with credibility, clarity, and a commitment to continuous learning.

**"I Don’t Just Manage Risk — I Teach It, Translate It, and Turn It Into Readiness."**

# Hello, I'm Toni
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elevatewithlatoniagardner"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>


I’m crafting my career path in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). When I’m not protecting systems and data, you can find me outdoors running, doing hot yoga, or spending time with my energetic furry-friend, Big Meech.

## OBJECTIVE
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity risk and compliance — with the long-term goal of contributing to GRC efforts in the Federal Government and higher education sectors. My background in business operations, customer technical support, and program management, has laid a solid foundation for me to transition into this field, specifically as a GRC Analyst.

# 👩🏾‍💻 About Toni Gardner

Toni’s journey isn’t the typical “tech from day one” story — and that’s her strategic advantage. For over six years, she honed the art of simplifying complexity, strengthening systems, and building trust — not through code, but in classrooms, teams, and mission-driven environments. As the digital landscape evolved, Toni pivoted from educator to cybersecurity professional, bringing analytical insight, emotional intelligence, and leadership into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).

Today, she’s a Security+ certified GRC Analyst with hands-on experience in auditing, risk assessments, vulnerability analysis, incident response, compliance frameworks, and policy alignment. She completed a multi-stage cybersecurity initiative modeled on real enterprise workflows, combining rigorous analysis with stakeholder-focused reporting.

Toni’s superpower lies in translating security risk into actionable insights. She connects human behavior to security posture, transforming complex data into narratives that executives can use — and teams can act on.

Beyond her technical expertise, Toni is a 200-hour certified yoga and meditation instructor, uniquely equipped to enhance team resilience, reduce burnout, and foster calm, focused decision-making in high-pressure environments.

She’s not just entering cybersecurity — she’s elevating it with credibility, clarity, and a commitment to continuous learning.
